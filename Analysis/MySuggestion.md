#### Processes Involved in the system

- database query
- crud of appointments
  - logins, its types, and its details
  - forms and their validation
- exits
- searches and views based on doctors or patients
- view of appointments of specified day with the default being the current day
- generate bills
- crud of patient history
- crud of doctor history

#### IO

- Login to both the admin accounts and the regular staff accounts
  - whether the login was successful
- After login, user should be able to see the appointments for the given day, ( maybe tie the amount of unique 'doctor' logins for the day to be counted and shown on the home screen as "Doctors available" )
- staff should be able to create an appointment, (idk how the doctors will link themselves to said appointment), with details provided by the customer, and the date set for the appointment
- doctors i assume should have admin access to update details, but idk about deleting
- generation of the bill with necessary details
- appropriate imformation for all views requested
- exit the application
